2	687	Villa - 7	"This is regarding Villa # 7 at Apparna Hill park Blvd.  We have two issues that need immediate attention to rectify.

1.  Seepage issue in the first floor bathroom that is causing water clotting above kitchen.
2.  Ceiling seepage issue that is causing water clotting above staircase to the first floor.


Both issues are critical as on a long term this might damage the ceiling and result in break-down. 

Thanks

Its more than 2 months the works have come and opened up the kitchen for testing the seepage. Now its proved that there is an issue with construction as water is leaking through the openings they have marked. However no one is responding to the calls nor any one is coming to complete the repair. THis is becoming really frustrating as this very critical and it might damage entire house if this continues.
Need urgent attention to this problem and this is beyond any escalations we have done so far.

Bhaskar"

8	449	Villa - 84	"Water seepage on the walls in many places. There is a flood of water on the floor in few places when it rains heavily. There is a high risk of slipping and falling down, especially when the water drips on the steps. Needs to be attended ASAP. Last week someone from the construction team came to check, identified where to fix. They said Saturday (yesterday) they will come to fix but did not show up or informed me of the change in plan. Need to coordinate with me on the timing so that I can home when someone comes to fix.

(ii) North side wall of living Room on Ground floor (iii) Staircase wall (Dining Area side)"	Complaint	Civil	Mr. D. V. Durga Rao	25-09-16 11:28	Boulevardpms	Yes	"677 days,6 hours"	In progress	27-03-17 16:19	"It has been 10 days since Aparna Constriction informed me that APMS would investigate the problem further. I have been following up with RamaKrishna, Brijesh and Pavan Kumar on daily basis, but no action has been initiated by APMS till date.
Aparna Construction team had broken terrace concrete as part of investigating / fixing the problem. Please see the photo attached. They wanted to close it without concluding the investigation and fixing the problem. I requested them to fix the water leakage problem and then close it, so that concrete breaking is not repeated as part of the solution.  
During the recent rain, some rain water must have entered into the walls through this terrace concrete opening. If the drain pipe leakage problem is not solved and concrete opening is not fixed back immediately, all the rain water can easily enter into the walls though the terrace concrete opening. I request Aparna to fix the original leakage problem and close this opening."
